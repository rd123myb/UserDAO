# UserDAO
A DAOstack DAO with a purpose built user testing feedback module and sentiment analysis engine, UserDAO rewards members for providing feedback on products and services. It does this by creating a platform for recording, aggregating, and selling access to demo-specific qualitative datasets + compute-to-data services, and sentiment analysis algorithms with auto-generated product reports. The data is generated and/or curated by UserDAO members, and sold on Ocean Market while maintaining user privacy and anonymity and revenue is distributed to member accounts in OCEAN.

## Members can vote to:
1) Assign roles within the DAO 
2) Change the user testing methodologies 
3) Remove members who do not contribute / contribute non-sensicle data consistantly
4) Change revenue distribution economics

## Reputation can be gained by:
1) Contributing quality data consistently 
2) Having proposals passed 
3) Securing direct dataset elicitation (clients) to the DAO

## Modifications:
to the DAO conduct and functionality can also be adjusted though voting. if passed, bounties are put up to incentivise implementation of features to an acceptable standard (as approved by vote or appointed DAO techlead).
