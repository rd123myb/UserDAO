# UserDAO
A DAOstack DAO with user testing feedback module and sentiment analysis engine. UserDAO rewards members for providing feedback on various products and services. It does this by creating a platform for recording, aggregating and selling access to demo-specific qualitative datasets and Compute-to-data services, including sentiment analysis algorithms. The data is generated and/or curated by UserDAO members, and datatokens are minted and sold Ocean Market to allow access to data services, all while maintaining member privacy and psudo-anonymity. Revenue from Ocean Market is distributed to DAO members in OCEAN tokens based on reputation, which is derived from contributions to the datasets marketed, and other contributions to UserDAO. A small percentage of sales revenue is held in a contract to fund DAO development initatives.

## Members can vote to:
1) Assign roles within the DAO 
2) Change the user testing methodologies 
3) Remove members who do not contribute / contribute non-sensicle data consistantly
4) Change revenue distribution economics

## Reputation can be gained by:
1) Contributing quality data consistently 
2) Having proposals passed 
3) Securing direct dataset elicitation (clients) to the DAO
4) Recruiting members to the DAO
5) Creating quality content about the DAO
6) Enhancing DAO visability

## Modifications:
to the DAO conduct and functionality can also be adjusted though voting. if passed, bounties are put up to incentivise implementation of features to an acceptable standard (as approved by vote or appointed DAO techlead).
