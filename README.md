# UserDAO
A user testing feedback DAO with sentiment analysis. UserDAO rewards members for providing feedback on various products and services. It does this by creating a platform for recording, aggregating and selling access to data, algorithms and reports generated by its members through the use of the UserDAO UI/UX testing kit. 

## Members can vote to:
1) Assign roles within the DAO 
2) Change the user testing methodologies 
3) Remove members who do not contribute / contribute non-sensicle data consistantly
4) Change revenue distribution economics
