          <p> UserDAO is a DataDao usecase that gives users the tools they need to generate structured data from the opinions on products.
              This data is valuable to companies who use it to develop products with better market fit. This can result in increased revenue and a durable competitive advantages.
              Currently, this type of high quality data is mostly gathered by either user testing, focus groups or surveys that don't incentivise consumers adequatly. Furthermore, most of this data is siloed within 
              the companies that pay to generate it, leaving countless potential for innovation unrealised at the expense of companies and
               consumers around the world.

               The specialised surveys and analysis tools are desinged to turn your thoughts and preferences about every aspect of
               a given product into the type of valuable data that companies need to compete in a competitive consumer market.

             Now with the power of Blockchain data markets, DAO's, and Decentralized finance, data daos can offer
               everyday consumers a direct market for thier opinions, all while helping smaller companies that would otherwise
               not have the resources to gather data at the scale needed to compete with larger companies in the data driven economy.
