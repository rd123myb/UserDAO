    <p> UserDAO is a decentralized and open-source system that gives users the tools to structure and pool their opinions into a dataset.
        This data is highly valuable to companies who use it to achieve good product market fit, yet is currently gathered by centralized user testing, focus groups or surveys that don't incentivise consumers adequately.
       
        </p>
       
        <p>Furthermore, most of this data is siloed within
        the companies that pay to generate it, leaving countless potential for innovation unrealised at the expense of
         consumers around the world.
    </p>

    <p> UserDAO members meet the demand for this data in an open marketplace.
        Specialized analysis tools can turn opinions into data, which has immense value when captured and structured at scale. UserDAO creates this effect and redistributes revenue back to
         contributions via smart contracts.

           <p>
             Through the advent of Blockchain powered data markets, DAO's, and Decentralized finance,
               everyday consumers now have a direct market to take thier opinions, all while helping smaller companies that would otherwise
               not have the resources to compete with larger companies in the data driven economy.
