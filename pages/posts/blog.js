          <p> UserDAO is a DataDao usecase that gives users the tools they need to generate structured data from the opinions they have about products.
              This data is valuable to companies who use it in thier development process to achieve market fit.
              Currently, this type of high quality data is gathered mostly by either user testing, focus groups or surveys that don't incentivise consumers adequatly. Furthermore, most of this data is siloed within 
              the companies that pay to generate it, leaving countless potential for innovation unrealised at the expense of 
               consumers around the world.
          </p>

          <p> UserDAO is a decentralized and open-source system for meeting this demand in an open marketplace.
              Specialised surveys and analysis tools are desinged to turn your thoughts and preferences about every aspect of
               a given product into the type of valuable data that companies need in a competitive consumer market. When these opinions
               are captured and structured at scale, thier value is immense. UserDAO creates this effect and redistrubtes revenue back to 
               contributiors via smart contracts.

           <p>It's obvious that some products are better than others, but the million dollar question is WHY.</p>
           <p>
             Through the advent of Blockchain powered data markets, DAO's, and Decentralized finance,
               everyday consumers now have a direct market to take thier opinions, all while helping smaller companies that would otherwise
               not have the resources to compete with larger companies in the data driven economy.
