    <p> UserDAO gives users the tools to structure their opinions into a dataset.
        This data can be used to predict product market fit and identify emerging trends. Currently it is gathered by expensive user testing methods that don't reward users as they should.
       
        </p>
       
        <p>This data is valuable to both large companies and agile operations. Yet it is often generated and siloed within large companies due to the cost of generating it. This centralises knowledge of how to meet consumer preferences, 
          resulting in lesser quality products for consumers, and less opportunity for innovation and competion by smaller operations in the consumer market.

    </p>

    <h3> The demand for this data can now be met in an open marketplace.</h3>

    <p>
        1) Specialised testing methods and analysis tools capture members opinions for specific products.
        </p><p>
        2) Opinions are transformed, structured and merged into a dataset that includes objective datapoints relating to the product.
        </p><p>
        3) Dataset is published on Ocean market to and sold for Ocean Tokens.
        </p><p>
        4) Revenue gained from sales is removed and distributed to DAO members via smart contracts.
        </p><p>
        5) Elected members fill in gaps where needed.

             Through the advent of Blockchain powered data markets, DAO's, and Decentralized finance,
               everyday consumers now have a direct market to take thier opinions, all while helping smaller companies that would otherwise
               not have the resources to compete with larger companies in the data driven economy.
