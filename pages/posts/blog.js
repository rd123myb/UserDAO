          <p> UserDAO is a decentralized and open-source system that gives users the tools structure thier opinions on products into a dataset.
              This data is highly valuable to companies who use it to achieve good product market fit, yet is currenty gathered by user testing, focus groups or surveys that don't incentivise consumers adequatly. 
              
              </p> 
              
              <p>Furthermore, most of this data is siloed within 
              the companies that pay to generate it, leaving countless potential for innovation unrealised at the expense of 
               consumers around the world.
          </p>

          <p> UserDAO members can meet the demand for this data in an open marketplace.
              Specialised analysis tools can turn your opinions into the type of data that companies want. When these opinions
               are captured and structured at scale, thier value is immense. UserDAO creates this effect and redistrubtes revenue back to 
               contributiors via smart contracts.

             Through the advent of Blockchain powered data markets, DAO's, and Decentralized finance,
               everyday consumers now have a direct market to take thier opinions, all while helping smaller companies that would otherwise
               not have the resources to compete with larger companies in the data driven economy.
