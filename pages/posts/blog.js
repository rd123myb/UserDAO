    <p> UserDAO is a decentralised and open-source system that gives users the tools to structure their opinions into a dataset.
        This data is valuable to companies who use it to achieve good product market fit and identify emerging trends, yet is currently gathered by centralized user testing, focus groups and surveys that don't incentivise consumers adequately.
       
        </p>
       
        <p>Furthermore, most of this data is siloed within
        the companies that pay to generate it, leaving countless potential for innovation unrealised at the expense of
         consumers.

    <h3> The demand for this data can now be met in an open marketplace.</h3>

             Through the advent of Blockchain powered data markets, DAO's, and Decentralized finance,
               everyday consumers now have a direct market to take thier opinions, all while helping smaller companies that would otherwise
               not have the resources to compete with larger companies in the data driven economy.
